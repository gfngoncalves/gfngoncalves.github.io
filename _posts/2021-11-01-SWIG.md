title: Using SWIG, CMake, conda and VSCode

I'm currently working on linking the simulator I'm writing in C++ to some [machine learning stuff](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/al_cfd_benchmark) I did in the past (in Python). The codebase is not huge or enormously complicated, but I didn't feel like writing all the wrapping code manually. I've used pybind11 before, but was tempted to try out [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) since it seems so powerful.

The good news is that a lot of the linking was automatic and quite seamless. Even returning Eigen arrays as numpy arrays worked quite well. I ended up using the interface wrappers (eigen.i and numpy.i files) from [swig-eigen-numpy](https://github.com/rdeits/swig-eigen-numpy/tree/master/swigmake/swig/python), with a small patch for Arrays. My interface file ended up looking something like this:

```C
%module [MY_MODULE_NAME]

%include <stl.i>
%include <typemaps.i>
%include <stdint.i>
%include <std_string.i>
%include <std_vector.i>
%include <std_map.i>
%include <inttypes.i>
%include <cpointer.i>
%include <exception.i>
%include <carrays.i>
%include <cdata.i>
%include <cwstring.i>
%include <intrusive_ptr.i>
%include <math.i>
%include <cpointer.i>
%include <std_except.i>

%{
#include <Python.h>
#include [MY_HEADER_1]
#include [MY_HEADER_2]
#include [HOWEVER_MANY_HEADERS...]
%}

namespace std {
  %template(VecDouble) vector<double>;
}

%include <eigen.i>

%eigen_typemaps(Eigen::VectorXd)
%eigen_typemaps(Eigen::MatrixXd)
%eigen_typemaps(Eigen::ArrayXXd)
%eigen_typemaps(Eigen::ArrayXd)

%include [MY_HEADER]
%include [MY_HEADER_2]
%include [HOWEVER_MANY_HEADERS...]
```

I basically had two main issues that did require some troubleshooting - neither directly related to SWIG or Python or my code, but actually due to my development environment.

First, the CMake extension for VSCode doesn't seem to activate the conda environment selected by the Python extension. This seems trivial in hindsight, but it took me a while to notice that the version shown in the CMake log wasn't the same as the one I was expecting in my tests.

The solution came from a [CMake Tools discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-cmake-tools/issues/1445). First, add something like this to a project cmake-kits.json: 
```JSON
[
      {
        "name": [SOME_NAME_HERE],
        "compilers": {
          "C": [SOME_COMPILER_HERE]
        },
        "environmentSetupScript": "${workspaceFolder}/.vscode/start_conda.sh"
      }
]
```
You can get the compiler name from `Command Palette... -> CMake: Edit User-Local CMake Kits`.

And then you should create a script start_conda.sh with:
```Shell
source /usr/local/Caskroom/miniconda/base/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate [YOUR_CONDA_ENV_NAME]
```

The second issue was a bit trickier... My code links to the system's OpenMP, and apparently conda ships with its own version of the library. That meant that when I imported numpy, for example, at the same time as my library, a segmentation fault resulted. The solution I found came from the [LightGBM FAQ](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/FAQ.html#lightgbm-crashes-randomly-with-the-error-like-initializing-libiomp5-dylib-but-found-libomp-dylib-already-initialized):
```Shell
for LIBOMP_ALIAS in libgomp.dylib libiomp5.dylib libomp.dylib; do sudo ln -sf "$(brew --cellar libomp)"/*/lib/libomp.dylib $CONDA_PREFIX/lib/$LIBOMP_ALIAS; done
```
